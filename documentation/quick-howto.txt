Adding events
=============

Events can be added from the Calendar tab in the admin backend.

If you don't enter the ,,date to'', the event is considered to be one day long.
In ,,description'' you can use HTML and insert a code in <?php ?>.


Configuration of the frontend
=============================

1. Make a subpage of your home page.
2. Name the subpage Events, Calendar, whatever you want.
3. Change the behaviour to ,,calendar''.
4. Insert in ,,body'' of the page:

    <?php showCalendar($this->slug); ?>

5. Works!


Customizing ,,the day'' page
=============================

1. Create an event.
2. Create a hidden subpage of the calendar page and set a slug (alias) to event's ,,date_from''.
3. The created subpage will be shown if you click on the date.


Disabling using the stored procedure
====================================

The Calendar Plugin uses one stored procedure. The procedure uses a temporary database table. Using of the procedure can be disabled.

Just define a constant:

  define('CALENDAR_USE_STORED_PROCEDURE', false);

The definition can be placed in index.php file of the plugin or in config.php file of WolfCMS installation.


Localizing the Calendar
=======================

The frontend view of the Calendar can be easily localized. Just add in your Wolf CMS config.php file:

  setlocale (LC_TIME /* or LC_ALL */, 'Dutch' /* of course here goes your language */);

(Un)fortunately this has one drawback: it localizes the dates on the entire page.


Functions available in the frontend
===================================

/** Shows a month calendar
  * @param $slug Slug of the calendar page. The slug becomes a base for links shown in the calendar.
  * @param $date Calendar shows $date's month. Null means ,,today''.
  */
function showCalendar($slug, $date = null)

/** Shows en event
  * @param $event An object of CalendarEvent class. Can be got with, i.e., CalendarEvent::findEventById().
  * @param $show_author If true, a box with the event's author is shown below the event's description.
  */
function showEvent($event, $show_author = true)

/** Shows array of events. Calls showEvent() in a loop, with $show_author = true */
