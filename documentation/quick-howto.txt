Adding events
=============

Events can be added from the Calendar tab in the admin backend.

If you don't enter the ,,date to'', the event is considered to be one day long.
In ,,description'' you can use HTML and insert a code in <?php ?>.


Configuration of the frontend
=============================

1. Make a subpage of your home page.
2. Name the subpage Events, Calendar, whatever you want.
3. Change the behaviour to ,,calendar''.
4. Insert in ,,body'' of the page:

    <?php showCalendar($this->slug); ?>

5. Works!


Customizing ,,the day'' page.
=============================

1. Create an event.
2. Create a subpage of the calendar page and set a slug (alias) to event's ,,date_from''.
3. The created subpage will be shown if you click on the date.


Functions available in the frontend

  * @param $slug Slug of the calendar page. The slug becomes a base for links shown in the calendar.
